NOTES
       Currently,  xdict  has  only a plaintext fuzzylogic search
       engine,  a  faster  hash  table  based  builtin   berkeley
       database engine is planned.

       Xdict fuzzy logic engine:
       Scientific  fuzzylogic  algorithms uses NGramms to compare
       common letters in dependence among themselves.

       Using fuzzylogic algorithms the requested  translation  of
       the  misstyped  german  word "Dampfscif" will nevertheless
       find the correct word "steamboat" from the database.   The
       database  contains more than 130'000 conversions, they are
       inside the plaintext database 'xdict.dat'.

REQUIREMENTS
       If you intend to run a stacically linked binary, you don't
       need  to  install the Gtk+ libaries before, if you plan to
       compile xdict from scratch, see below.

MANUALLY INSTALLATION
       1) Login as root
       2) Create a new folder /usr/local/xdict
       3) Move the xdict binary to /usr/local/bin
       4) Move xdict.dat to /usr/local/xdict
       5) Move all other files to /usr/local/xdict
       6) Move xdict.1 to /usr/man/man1 (or read with man -l)
       7) Logout (exit) from root, login as normal user
       8) Run xdict: 'xdict -d /usr/local/xdict/xdict.dat'

BUILDING XDICT
       Compile source against the newest Gtk+ libraries available
       from  http://www.gtk.org.  Type:  ./configure  followed by
       make ; then su - root and a make install, please note that
       xdict.dat  will  not  be  installed automatically.  If you
       need a  statically  linked  binary,  make  sure  you  link
       against  existing  object  files in your path. Anyway - do
       with the source what you want you want under the terms  of
       the general public license.

ERRORS
       Running  xdict  without  options will use xdict.dat in the
       same directory where the binary  is,  otherwise  an  error
       message occured.

EXAMPLES
       xdict --d /home/johnson/xdict.dat

KNOWN BUGS
       On some debian systems, X locale modifiers  are  not  sup-
       ported.  This  is a problem with a missing local directory
       from the current setup e.g.  debian  slink  aka  GNU/Linux
       2.1.  The latest version of the xlib6g package solve this.

TODO
       -Contributions and cooperations are welcome
       -build several statically linked binary distributions.
       -create rpm and deb packages.
       -and all what you suggest...
